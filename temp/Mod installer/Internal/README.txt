Since version 1.2, this folder is only used by the "Compiler INTERNAL folder" functionality in the Tools menu.
In its default state, this folder contains the source code of the modified CHARASELE.iggy used by XV2 Mods Installer, 
where slots are retrieved from an external file with the help of the patcher.

You can make your changes to the ActionScript code here, and then run the compilation in the tools menu.
Don't change the tag property at XV2Patcher.as, otherwise the installer could rewrite its internal default iggy.
